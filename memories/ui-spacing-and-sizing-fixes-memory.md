2. **Better Vertical Spacing**: Increased spacing between labels and their associated controls
3. **Proper Text Display**: All text labels now have sufficient width and height to display their full content
4. **Aligned Browse Buttons**: Browse buttons are now properly aligned with their corresponding textboxes

## Files Modified

- `MainForm.cs` - Updated UI control positioning and sizing in `CreateControls()` and `CreateSetupControls()` methods

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the application and verify all text labels display completely without cutoff
2. Check that spacing between elements looks visually balanced
3. Verify that browse buttons align properly with their textboxes
4. Test both the initial setup screen and the main configuration interface

## Notes

- All changes maintain the existing functionality while improving the visual presentation
- The form size remains the same (800x700) as the spacing adjustments were made within the existing boundaries
- These fixes address the specific UI bugs mentioned in the user request
