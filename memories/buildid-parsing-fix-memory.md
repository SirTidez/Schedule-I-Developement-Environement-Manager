# Build ID Parsing Fix Memory

## Task Completed
Fixed the issue where the build ID was not being correctly read from Steam app manifest files.

## Problem Identified
The application was looking for `"BuildID"` (with capital letters and spaces) in the Steam app manifest, but the actual format in the manifest file is `"buildid"` (lowercase, no spaces).

## Root Cause
The regex pattern in `ParseBuildIdFromManifest()` method was incorrect:
- **Incorrect pattern**: `"\"BuildID\"\\s+\"([^\"]+)\""`
- **Correct pattern**: `"\"buildid\"\\s+\"([^\"]+)\""`

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified
- **Services/SteamService.cs** - Updated the `ParseBuildIdFromManifest()` method

### Changes Made
1. **Updated regex pattern**: Changed from `"BuildID"` to `"buildid"`
2. **Updated comments**: Updated method documentation to reflect the correct format
3. **Updated log messages**: Changed log messages to use lowercase "buildid" for consistency

### Before (Incorrect)
```csharp
// Look for BuildID in the manifest
var buildIdMatch = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(manifestContent, "\"BuildID\"\\s+\"([^\"]+)\"");
```

### After (Correct)
```csharp
// Look for buildid in the manifest (lowercase, no spaces as per Steam's format)
var buildIdMatch = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Match(manifestContent, "\"buildid\"\\s+\"([^\"]+)\"");
```

## Technical Details

### Steam App Manifest Format
Based on the example `appmanifest_3164500.acf` file:
```
"AppState"
{
    "appid"        "3164500"
    "buildid"      "19748475"
    "name"         "Schedule I"
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Key Points
- The build ID field is `"buildid"` (lowercase, no spaces)
- It's located in the `AppState` section
- The value is a string containing the numeric build identifier
- This format is consistent across Steam app manifests

## Impact of Fix

### Before Fix
- Build ID parsing would fail silently
- Logs would show "No BuildID found in manifest"
- Configuration would not include build ID information
- Branch build ID tracking would not work properly

### After Fix
- Build ID parsing works correctly
- Logs show "Found buildid in manifest: {BuildId}"
- Configuration properly tracks build IDs for each branch
- Full branch and build ID information is available

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors
- ✅ **Regex Pattern**: Correctly matches `"buildid"` field in manifest
- ✅ **Logging**: Proper build ID detection logging
- ✅ **Configuration**: Build IDs are now properly stored and retrieved

## Files Affected

1. **Services/SteamService.cs** - `ParseBuildIdFromManifest()` method updated

## Related Functionality

This fix affects:
- Branch detection and build ID extraction
- Configuration storage of build IDs per branch
- Logging of Steam manifest parsing
- Branch switching validation

## Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- All existing build ID storage and retrieval methods continue to work
- The change only affects the parsing of the Steam manifest file
- Build ID information is now properly captured and stored for each detected branch

This fix ensures that the application correctly reads build ID information from Steam app manifests, enabling proper tracking of different game versions across branches.
