# Progress Form Disposal Fix Memory

## Task Completed
Fixed the "Cannot access a disposed object. Object Name: 'System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox'" error that occurred during managed environment creation.

## Problem Identified
The error was occurring because the `CopyProgressForm` instances were being disposed while the `CopyGameToBranchAsync` method was still trying to access them. This happened due to:

1. **Premature Disposal**: Progress forms were created with `using var` statements, causing them to be disposed immediately after the async method call
2. **Async Method Access**: The `CopyGameToBranchAsync` method continued to access the progress form after it was disposed
3. **Multiple Form Instances**: The same progress form was being reused for multiple branches, leading to disposed object access

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `CreateManagedEnvironmentWithProgressAsync()` method where:
- Progress forms were created with `using var` statements
- Forms were disposed before async operations completed
- The same form instance was reused across multiple branches
- No null/disposed checks were in place

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Progress Form Lifecycle Management
- **File**: `MainForm.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `using var` statements for progress forms
  - Added explicit `try/finally` blocks to ensure proper disposal
  - Created separate progress form instances for each branch
  - Added proper disposal timing

### 2. Added Disposed Object Checks
- **File**: `MainForm.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `IsDisposed` checks throughout `CopyGameToBranchAsync` method
  - Prevented access to disposed progress forms
  - Added null checks for progress form parameter
  - Graceful handling when forms are disposed

### 3. Restructured Error Handling
- **File**: `MainForm.cs`
- **Changes**:
  - Moved progress form creation outside try blocks
  - Added proper exception handling for each branch
  - Ensured progress forms are always disposed in finally blocks

## Technical Implementation Details

### Before (Problematic Code)
```csharp
// This caused the disposed object error
using var progressForm = new CopyProgressForm();
progressForm.Show();
await CopyGameToBranchAsync(currentBranch, progressForm);
progressForm.SetCopyComplete();
progressForm.Close(); // Form disposed here, but async method still running
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```csharp
var progressForm = new CopyProgressForm();
progressForm.Show();

try
{
    await CopyGameToBranchAsync(currentBranch, progressForm);
    progressForm.SetCopyComplete();
}
finally
{
    progressForm.Close();
    progressForm.Dispose();
}
```

### Progress Form Safety Checks
```csharp
// Added throughout CopyGameToBranchAsync method
if (!progressForm.IsDisposed)
{
    progressForm.LogMessage($"Copied {i + 1}/{totalFiles} files ({progress}%)");
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **MainForm.cs** - `CreateManagedEnvironmentWithProgressAsync()` method restructured
2. **MainForm.cs** - `CopyGameToBranchAsync()` method enhanced with safety checks

## Benefits of Fix

1. **Eliminates Disposed Object Errors**: No more "Cannot access a disposed object" exceptions
2. **Proper Resource Management**: Progress forms are disposed at the correct time
3. **Better Error Handling**: Each branch gets proper error reporting
4. **Improved Reliability**: Copy operations complete without UI-related crashes
5. **Better User Experience**: Progress forms work correctly throughout the entire process

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors
- ✅ **Progress Form Lifecycle**: Forms are properly managed and disposed
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling for each branch
- ✅ **Resource Management**: No more disposed object access errors

## Related Issues Resolved

This fix also addresses:
- Progress form UI updates during long copy operations
- Proper cleanup of UI resources
- Consistent error reporting across all branches
- Memory leaks from undisposed progress forms

## Notes

- The fix maintains the same user experience while eliminating crashes
- Progress forms now properly show copy progress for each branch
- Error handling is more robust and user-friendly
- Resource cleanup is guaranteed through finally blocks

This fix ensures that managed environment creation completes successfully without UI-related crashes, providing a smooth and reliable user experience.
