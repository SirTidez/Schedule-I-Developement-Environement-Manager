# Branch Switch Prompt Timing Fix Memory

## Task Completed
Fixed the issue where the Branch Switch Prompt Form was not being shown at the correct time during managed environment creation.

## Problem Identified
The application was showing the branch switch prompt AFTER copying a branch, which was too late. Users need to be instructed to switch branches BEFORE copying so they can have the correct game version installed.

## Root Cause
The original logic had the wrong flow:
1. Copy current branch
2. For each selected branch:
   - Copy the branch first
   - Then show branch switch prompt (too late!)

This meant users were copying branches without having switched to them first, resulting in incorrect game versions being copied.

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified
- **MainForm.cs** - `CreateManagedEnvironmentWithProgressAsync()` method restructured

### Changes Made
1. **Reordered the workflow**: Branch switch prompt now appears BEFORE copying each branch
2. **Proper branch switching**: User switches to target branch before copy operation begins
3. **Updated current branch tracking**: Current branch is updated after successful switch
4. **Eliminated redundant logic**: Removed the old branch switch logic that was in the wrong place

## Technical Implementation Details

### Before (Incorrect Flow)
```csharp
// This was the wrong order
foreach (var branch in _config.SelectedBranches)
{
    // Copy branch first (wrong!)
    await CopyGameToBranchAsync(branch, branchProgressForm);
    
    // Then show switch prompt (too late!)
    if (branchIndex < _config.SelectedBranches.Count)
    {
        var nextBranch = _config.SelectedBranches[branchIndex];
        // Show switch prompt for NEXT branch
    }
}
```

### After (Correct Flow)
```csharp
foreach (var branch in _config.SelectedBranches)
{
    // Show branch switch prompt FIRST
    using var switchPrompt = new BranchSwitchPromptForm(currentBranch, branch);
    var result = switchPrompt.ShowDialog();
    
    // Wait for user to actually switch the branch
    var switchSuccess = await _steamService.WaitForBranchSwitchAsync(branch, _config.GameInstallPath);
    
    // Update current branch for next iteration
    currentBranch = branch;
    
    // NOW copy the branch after switching to it
    await CopyGameToBranchAsync(branch, branchProgressForm);
}
```

## New Workflow

1. **Copy Current Branch**: Start with the currently installed branch
2. **For Each Selected Branch**:
   - Show branch switch prompt: "Please switch from [current] to [target] branch"
   - Wait for user to actually switch in Steam
   - Verify branch switch was successful
   - Update current branch tracking
   - Copy the branch (now with correct game version)
3. **Complete**: All branches copied with correct versions

## Benefits of Fix

1. **Correct Game Versions**: Each branch is copied with the right game version installed
2. **Clear User Instructions**: Users know exactly when to switch branches
3. **Proper Workflow**: Branch switching happens at the logical time
4. **Better User Experience**: No confusion about when to switch branches
5. **Accurate Environment**: Managed environment contains correct game versions for each branch

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors
- ✅ **Correct Flow**: Branch switch prompts appear at the right time
- ✅ **User Guidance**: Clear instructions for when to switch branches
- ✅ **Proper Timing**: Users switch before copying, not after

## User Experience Flow

1. User clicks "Create Environment"
2. Current branch is copied first
3. For each additional branch:
   - Dialog appears: "Please switch from [current] to [target] branch"
   - User switches branch in Steam
   - Application detects the switch
   - Branch is copied with correct game version
4. Process continues until all branches are copied

## Notes

- The fix ensures that each branch contains the correct game version
- Users get clear, timely instructions about when to switch branches
- The workflow is now logical and user-friendly
- Branch switching verification prevents copying with wrong versions

This fix ensures that the managed environment creation process properly guides users through branch switching at the correct time, resulting in accurate game version copies for each branch.
