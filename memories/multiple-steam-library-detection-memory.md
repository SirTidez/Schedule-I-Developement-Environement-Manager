# Multiple Steam Library Detection and Selection Memory

## Task Completed
Successfully implemented functionality to detect multiple Steam libraries, present a selection dialog to users, and prioritize C: drive libraries by default.

## Problem Identified
The original application only used the first Steam library found and didn't provide users with a choice when multiple libraries were detected. This could lead to issues if Schedule I was installed in a different library than the one automatically selected.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced SteamService
**File**: `Services/SteamService.cs`
**Changes**:
- Modified `GetSteamLibraryPaths()` to sort libraries with C: drive priority
- Added `GetDefaultSteamLibraryPath()` method for getting the recommended library
- Added `FindScheduleIGameInLibraries()` method to search across all libraries

**Library Prioritization Logic**:
```csharp
// Sort libraries to prioritize C: drive
libraryPaths = libraryPaths.OrderBy(path => 
{
    var drive = Path.GetPathRoot(path);
    return drive?.ToUpper() == "C:\\" ? 0 : 1;
}).ToList();
```

### 2. New Library Selection Dialog
**File**: `SteamLibrarySelectionDialog.cs`
**Features**:
- Modal dialog showing all detected Steam libraries
- C: drive libraries marked as "Recommended"
- User-friendly interface with clear selection options
- Proper error handling and status feedback

**Dialog Features**:
- Lists all Steam libraries with drive information
- Highlights C: drive libraries as recommended
- Provides clear instructions for user selection
- Handles cancellation gracefully

### 3. Enhanced MainForm Functionality
**File**: `MainForm.cs`
**Changes**:
- Modified `LoadSteamInformation()` to detect multiple libraries
- Added `ShowLibrarySelectionDialog()` method for library selection
- Enhanced `LoadGamesFromLibrary()` with cross-library search
- Added `SearchOtherLibrariesForScheduleI()` for automatic library switching

**Library Detection Flow**:
1. Detect all Steam libraries
2. If single library: use directly
3. If multiple libraries: show selection dialog
4. If Schedule I not found in selected library: search other libraries
5. Offer to switch to library containing Schedule I

### 4. Cross-Library Game Search
**Implementation**:
- Automatically searches all libraries when Schedule I not found
- Presents user with option to switch to library containing the game
- Maintains user choice if they prefer to stay with selected library
- Provides clear feedback about found games in other libraries

## Technical Implementation Details

### Library Path Detection
- Reads Steam's `libraryfolders.vdf` file for additional library locations
- Includes default Steam library path
- Validates all paths exist before adding to list

### User Experience Improvements
- Clear status messages throughout the process
- Visual indicators for recommended libraries (C: drive)
- Graceful handling of user cancellation
- Automatic fallback to search other libraries

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging purposes
- Graceful degradation when libraries not found

## Benefits of New Implementation

1. **User Choice**: Users can select which Steam library to use
2. **C: Drive Priority**: Automatically recommends C: drive libraries
3. **Cross-Library Search**: Finds games regardless of which library they're in
4. **Better UX**: Clear feedback and intuitive interface
5. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases and provides fallbacks

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Services/SteamService.cs** - Enhanced with library prioritization and cross-library search
2. **SteamLibrarySelectionDialog.cs** - New dialog for library selection
3. **SteamLibrarySelectionDialog.Designer.cs** - Designer file for the dialog
4. **MainForm.cs** - Enhanced with library selection and cross-library search logic

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors
- ✅ **Code Structure**: Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling implemented
- ✅ **User Interface**: Intuitive dialog design with clear options

## Future Enhancements

1. **Library Validation**: Verify library integrity before offering selection
2. **Game Detection**: Show which games are available in each library
3. **Library Management**: Allow users to add/remove library paths
4. **Performance**: Cache library information to avoid repeated scanning
5. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages

## Notes

- The implementation prioritizes user experience while maintaining robust error handling
- C: drive libraries are automatically recommended but users can still choose alternatives
- Cross-library search provides a safety net when games aren't found in the selected library
- The dialog is modal and user-friendly, preventing confusion during library selection
- All existing functionality remains intact while adding new capabilities

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience when dealing with multiple Steam libraries and ensures users can always find and use their Schedule I installation regardless of which library it's installed in.
