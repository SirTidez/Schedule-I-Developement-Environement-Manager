# Branch Detection Functionality Implementation Memory

## Task Completed
Successfully implemented branch detection functionality and added a dropdown selection above the branch selection checkboxes in the Schedule I Development Environment Manager.

## New Features Added

### 1. Branch Detection Service
- **File**: `Services/SteamService.cs`
- **Method**: `DetectInstalledBranch(string gameInstallPath)`
- **Functionality**: Automatically detects which branch of Schedule I is currently installed by examining:
  - Branch indicator files (branch.txt, version.txt, buildinfo.txt, steam_appid.txt)
  - Executable names for branch indicators
  - Subdirectory names for branch indicators
  - Falls back to "main-branch" if no indicators found

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Model
- **File**: `Models/DevEnvironmentConfig.cs`
- **New Property**: `InstalledBranch` - tracks which branch is currently detected/selected
- **Purpose**: Stores the detected branch information for use throughout the application

### 3. Updated User Interface
- **File**: `MainForm.cs`
- **New Control**: `cboCurrentBranch` - ComboBox dropdown above branch selection checkboxes
- **Layout Changes**: 
  - Added "Currently Installed Branch" section at Y=200
  - Moved branch selection section down to Y=260
  - Adjusted all subsequent control positions accordingly
  - Increased form height from 600 to 700 pixels

### 4. Automatic Branch Detection
- **Integration Points**:
  - `LoadGamesFromLibrary()` - detects branch when Steam games are loaded
  - `BtnBrowseGameInstall_Click()` - detects branch when manually browsing for game folder
- **Behavior**: Automatically populates the dropdown and selects the appropriate checkbox

### 5. Manual Branch Selection
- **Event Handler**: `CurrentBranch_SelectionChanged()`
- **Functionality**: Allows users to manually override the detected branch
- **Auto-sync**: Automatically updates the checkbox selection when dropdown changes

### 6. Smart Checkbox Management
- **Method**: `AutoSelectDetectedBranch(string detectedBranch)`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Clears all existing checkbox selections
  - Automatically checks the appropriate checkbox based on detected/selected branch
  - Updates the configuration accordingly

## Technical Implementation Details

### Branch Detection Logic
```csharp
// Priority order for branch detection:
1. Check branch indicator files for keywords (beta, test, alternate, main, stable, release)
2. Check executable names for branch keywords
3. Check subdirectory names for branch keywords
4. Default to "main-branch" if no indicators found
```

### UI Control Hierarchy
```
Form (800x700)
├── Steam Library Section (Y=20-70)
├── Game Installation Section (Y=80-130)
├── Managed Environment Section (Y=140-190)
├── Current Branch Detection (Y=200-250)
│   ├── Label: "Currently Installed Branch:"
│   └── ComboBox: Branch selection dropdown
├── Branch Selection Section (Y=260-320)
│   ├── Label: "Select Branches for Managed Environment:"
│   └── CheckBoxes: Main, Beta, Alternate, Alternate Beta
├── Status and Progress (Y=330-390)
└── Action Buttons (Y=400-450)
```

### Event Handling Chain
```
Branch Detection → Dropdown Update → Checkbox Auto-selection → Configuration Update
     ↓
Manual Dropdown Change → Checkbox Auto-selection → Configuration Update
```

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **User Experience**: Users can now see which branch they currently have installed
2. **Automation**: Reduces manual configuration by auto-detecting the installed branch
3. **Flexibility**: Users can manually override the detected branch if needed
4. **Consistency**: Ensures the selected branches align with the current installation
5. **Intelligence**: Smart detection based on multiple indicators in the game files

## Files Modified

1. **Services/SteamService.cs** - Added `DetectInstalledBranch()` method
2. **Models/DevEnvironmentConfig.cs** - Added `InstalledBranch` property
3. **MainForm.cs** - Added dropdown control, updated UI layout, added event handlers

## Testing Status

- ✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors
- ✅ **Code Structure**: All new methods and properties properly integrated
- ✅ **UI Layout**: Form controls properly positioned and sized
- ⚠️ **Runtime Testing**: Application builds but runtime testing pending

## Future Enhancements

1. **Branch Validation**: Add validation to ensure selected branches are compatible
2. **Configuration Persistence**: Save detected branch information to configuration file
3. **Branch Metadata**: Store additional branch information (version, build date, etc.)
4. **Multi-Game Support**: Extend detection to support multiple game installations
5. **Branch Comparison**: Add functionality to compare different branch versions

## Notes

- The branch detection logic is designed to be extensible for future branch types
- All new functionality follows the existing code patterns and error handling
- The UI changes maintain the existing visual style and user experience
- Branch detection is non-intrusive and falls back gracefully if detection fails

This implementation successfully addresses the user's requirements for branch detection and manual selection while maintaining the existing application architecture and user experience.
