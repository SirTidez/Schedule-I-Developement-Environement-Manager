# Configuration System Implementation Memory

## Task Completed
Successfully implemented a comprehensive configuration system for the Schedule I Development Environment Manager that saves all user selections and build IDs to a JSON configuration file in the user's AppData\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule I folder.

## System Overview

### 1. Configuration Service (`Services/ConfigurationService.cs`)
- **Purpose**: Manages persistence of application configuration
- **Location**: Saves to `%AppData%\LocalLow\TVGS\Schedule I\dev_environment_config.json`
- **Features**:
  - Automatic directory creation if it doesn't exist
  - JSON serialization with proper formatting
  - Async save/load operations
  - Error handling and logging

### 2. Enhanced Configuration Model (`Models/DevEnvironmentConfig.cs`)
- **New Properties**:
  - `BranchBuildIds`: Dictionary mapping branch names to build IDs
  - `LastUpdated`: Timestamp of last configuration change
  - `ConfigVersion`: Version tracking for configuration format
- **New Methods**:
  - `GetBuildIdForBranch()`: Retrieves build ID for specific branch
  - `SetBuildIdForBranch()`: Updates build ID for specific branch
  - `UpdateConfiguration()`: Bulk update of configuration values

### 3. Enhanced Steam Service (`Services/SteamService.cs`)
- **New Methods**:
  - `GetBuildIdFromManifest()`: Extracts build ID from Steam app manifest
  - `GetBranchAndBuildIdFromManifest()`: Gets both branch and build ID in one call
  - `ParseBuildIdFromManifest()`: Parses BuildID field from manifest content

### 4. Main Form Integration (`MainForm.cs`)
- **Configuration Loading**: Automatically loads saved configuration on startup
- **Configuration Saving**: Saves configuration whenever user makes changes
- **Build ID Display**: Shows current build IDs for all branches in real-time
- **Auto-save Triggers**:
  - Steam library path changes
  - Game install path changes
  - Managed environment path changes
  - Branch selection changes
  - After successful environment creation

## Configuration File Structure

The configuration is saved as JSON with the following structure:
```json
{
  "steamLibraryPath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps",
  "gameInstallPath": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Schedule I",
  "managedEnvironmentPath": "D:\\Schedule I Development",
  "selectedBranches": ["main-branch", "beta-branch"],
  "installedBranch": "beta-branch",
  "branchBuildIds": {
    "main-branch": "12345678",
    "beta-branch": "87654321",
    "alternate-branch": "",
    "alternate-beta-branch": ""
  },
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00",
  "configVersion": "1.0"
}
```

## Build ID Extraction Process

### 1. Steam App Manifest Location
- Game install path: `.../steamapps/common/Schedule I`
- Manifest path: `.../steamapps/appmanifest_3164500.acf`

### 2. Manifest Parsing
- **Branch Detection**: Extracts `UserConfig.BetaKey` field
- **Build ID Detection**: Extracts `BuildID` field
- **Regex Patterns**:
  - Branch: `"BetaKey"\\s+"([^"]+)"`
  - Build ID: `"BuildID"\\s+"([^"]+)"`

### 3. Branch Mapping
- "beta" → "beta-branch"
- "alternate" → "alternate-branch"
- "alternate-beta" → "alternate-beta-branch"
- Default → "main-branch"

## User Interface Enhancements

### 1. Configuration Information Display
- **Location**: Below branch selection checkboxes
- **Content**:
  - Configuration version and last updated timestamp
  - Steam library, game install, and managed environment paths
  - Currently installed branch
  - Build IDs for all branches with selection status

### 2. Real-time Updates
- Configuration info updates automatically when changes are made
- Build IDs are refreshed when Steam information is loaded
- Selection status shows which branches are currently selected

## Configuration Persistence Strategy

### 1. Automatic Saving
- **Triggered by**: Any user interaction that changes configuration
- **Frequency**: Real-time (immediate save after each change)
- **Location**: User's AppData folder (persistent across sessions)

### 2. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback to default configuration if loading fails
- Logging of all configuration operations
- User notification of configuration status

### 3. Data Validation
- Configuration is validated before saving
- Required fields are checked before enabling environment creation
- Build IDs are verified against Steam manifests

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Dependency Injection
- `ConfigurationService` is registered in the service collection
- Proper separation of concerns between services
- Async/await pattern for file operations

### 2. Event Handling
- Configuration saving is triggered by UI control events
- Branch selection changes automatically save configuration
- File system operations are non-blocking

### 3. Memory Management
- Configuration objects are properly disposed
- File handles are managed correctly
- No memory leaks from configuration operations

## Benefits of New System

1. **Persistence**: User selections are remembered across application sessions
2. **Build ID Tracking**: Current build IDs are automatically detected and saved
3. **Real-time Updates**: Configuration changes are immediately reflected in the UI
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of configuration file issues
5. **User Experience**: No need to re-enter information on each launch
6. **Development Support**: Build ID tracking helps with development workflow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Configuration Migration**: Support for upgrading between configuration versions
2. **Backup/Restore**: Ability to backup and restore configurations
3. **Multiple Profiles**: Support for multiple development environment configurations
4. **Cloud Sync**: Optional cloud synchronization of configurations
5. **Configuration Validation**: More sophisticated validation rules
6. **Build ID History**: Track build ID changes over time

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors
- ✅ **Service Integration**: Configuration service properly integrated
- ✅ **UI Updates**: Configuration info display implemented
- ✅ **Auto-save**: Configuration saves automatically on changes
- ✅ **Build ID Extraction**: Steam manifest parsing implemented
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for configuration issues

## Notes

- The configuration system is designed to be non-intrusive and automatic
- All user selections are preserved and restored on application restart
- Build IDs are automatically extracted from Steam app manifests
- The system handles both single and multiple Steam library scenarios
- Configuration files are human-readable JSON for easy debugging
- The system is extensible for future configuration requirements

This implementation provides a robust foundation for managing development environment configurations while maintaining a seamless user experience.
